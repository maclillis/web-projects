For simplicity I removed all the fonts and image assets. If you want to run the apps, please go to my portfolio for that.

## A brief notice from the author
These particular "apps" or creative chunks of code has all been taken from ads that are loaded in a square format through an iframe on a website. Since they were developed and designed to go through an ad plattform that has a backend-engine that makes Facebooks server hall look like a tool shed, alot of special non-standard web development procedures had to be taken. Examplaes of these include inline styling, use of raw JavaScript instead of jQuery, so I want you to have a bit of patience on how it is structured.
